# Project_1
This project is about predicting my daily energy score (0–100) based on different lifestyle factors like steps, sleep, water, caffeine, and stress. I’m using PyTorch to build a linear regression model for this.
For Deliverable 1, I put together two main pieces:
* Synthetic Data Function (make_synthetic_energy_data) : creates a dataset with realistic values for my features and an energy score.
* Regression Model Class (WellnessRegressor) : a simple PyTorch model that can learn the relationship between those features and the energy score.
